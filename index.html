<p class="blurbs">Hello world! This is my website, that I periodically update that serves as a portfolio,
	as well as a general hub of my interests, past-projects, and general thoughts. Whether I post programs I've made, reviews, or games, really this website is just
	a spliced up collage of ideas. Some of the projects aren't just grown using the fruits of my labor, some are also collaborations between me and my friends and other people
	I have the pleasure of working with. I hope to expand this website to cover more topics, also just in general try to make it look better. This website is an ongoing project and
	will expand and improve as the years go on

<div class="aligner">
<p class="blurbs2">I adore programming. I know that essentially means I'm condemned to never leaving the house or forming any remote connection with anyone, but hey, you like 
	what you like. Under the "Programs" page, I post some of my projects, most of which are coded in C/C++, although there are some exceptions to this. It also includes certain hardware
	projects I've undertaken, and in general the lil' blurbs go over the overview of the project, what was achieved, and how to set it up for yourself if you want to. 'Course you obviously
	have to have the compilers and what not

<p class="blurbs2">Books, movies, video games, any form of media really (or otherwise). Everyone has their thoughts and opinions on the things they read, watch and play.
	Under "Reviews", you'll be able to find a variety of well, reviews on a plethora of media (and otherwise). I'm working on adding a comment system so
	users can share their thoughts on opinions as well, although uh, that's a major work in progress

<h2 style="margin-left: 2%;">Games</h2>
<div class="aligner">
<p class="blurbs2">Whether it be chess, a 15 puzzle, or a fighting game with creative cast of characters, we have games. The games are 
	accessible through the aptly named "Games" tab. Try 'em out and have some fun with them. They were made by one nutty programmer and some 
	extravagantly talented artists, and they're a pretty  fun time-killer for browser games, (although I might be a bit biased in saying that)
