<p class="blurbs">This is chess. The AI is kind of wacky but it is in fact, an AI. When you click on a piece it displays what moves are available, if no squares highlight, 
it means that there is no legal move you can make with that piece, so pick a new piece. Aside from that? It's chess,  plain and simple.</p>
<br>

<h2 class="labeler">FIGHTING GAME</h2>
<script src="fightingGame.js"></script>
<br>
<br>
<p class="blurbs">This is a fighting game in JavaScript. Currently, you can play as 2 characters, Dracaena, and Richard. 
Dracaena is a dragon warrior echoing the myths of the monsters slayed by ancient greek gods. Richard is a human wing-dang-doodle in a mech suit. 
Simply click play, and you'll be greeted by a new screen with the 2 character's icons presented. Click on the one you want for player 1, and then player 2. 
Player 1's character MUST be selected before player 2's. The controls for player 1 are 'W' for jumping, 'A' and 'D' for moving side to side, and space to attack. 
Player 2's controls are the arrow keys with down arrow being for attack. 
When a player is defeated it'll send you back to the play again screen, wait a moment and then you can play again.

<p class="blurbs">This is a 15 puzzle. The goal is to get it lined up so it is arranged in numerical order 1-15. It's probably harder than you think, or maybe I'm just bad. 
	I thought it'd be a cool thing to program, it didn't take very long to make, but it most assuredly took more than I would of liked.</p>
